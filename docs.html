          These are some advices to help protect yourself on the internet!

        <div class="advices">
          <ol>
            <li>Do <b>NOT</b> share your password to <b>ANYONE</b>.</li>
            <li>
              Do <b>NOT</b> use the same password, security questions and
              answers for multiple important accounts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a password that has at least 20 characters, use at least one
              number, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter and one special
              symbol.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do <b>NOT</b> use the names of your families, friends or pets in
              your passwords.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do <b>NOT</b> use postcodes, house numbers, phone numbers,
              birthdates, ID card numbers, social security numbers, and so on in
              your passwords
            </li>
            <li>Do <b>NOT</b> click on any suspicious email or SMS message.</li>
            <li>Lock your computer and mobile phone when you leave them.</li>
            <li>It's recommended to change your passwords every 10 weeks.</li>
            <li>Turn on 2-step authentication whenever possible.</li>
            <li>
              When travelling, you can encrypt your Internet connections before
              they leave your laptop, tablet, mobile phone or router. For
              example, you can set up a private VPN with protocols like
              WireGuard( or IKEv2, OpenVPN, SSTP, L2TP over IPSec ) on your own
              server( home computer, dedicated server or VPS ) and connect to
              it. Alternatively, you can set up an encrypted SSH tunnel between
              your computer and your own server and configure Chrome or FireFox
              to use socks proxy. Then even if somebody captures your data as it
              is transmitted between your device( e.g. laptop, iPhone, iPad )
              and your server with a packet sniffer, they'll won't be able to
              steal your data and passwords from the encrypted streaming data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do <b>NOT</b> send sensitive information online via unencrypted
              (e.g.HTTP or FTP) connections. You should use encrypted
              connections such as HTTPS, SFTP, FTPS, SMTPS, IPSec whenever
              possible.
